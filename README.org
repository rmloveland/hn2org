* Overview

  This is a script that fetches a discussion thread from Hacker News
  using its [[https://github.com/HackerNews/API][API]], and converts it to [[http://orgmode.org][Org]] mode for convenient reading
  from [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

  NOTE: This is a "first draft", and it's rather slow due to
  inefficient network usage, this should be improved in the future.

* Usage

  For example, given this URL:

  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10879529

  run this command in your terminal:

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
  $ hn2org 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10879529' > /path/to/file.org
  #+END_SRC

  Now you can open up =file.org= in Emacs, and enjoy reading HN
  comments with per-thread folding and unfolding.  In particular,
  reading deeply nested subthreads is much easier than on the website.

* Prerequisites

  - Perl version 5.16 or higher
  - The [[https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON][JSON]] module (available from CPAN)
