Fetch a page of discussion threads from Hacker News by ID, and convert
it to Org.

For example, given this URL:

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10879529

Issue this command:

$ hn2org 10879529 > /path/to/file.org

Open up `file.org` in Emacs, and enjoy reading threaded comments in an
interface that actually supports them in a sane fashion.
